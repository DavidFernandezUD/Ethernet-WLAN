# Ethernet vs. WLAN

## Why is the Selected Topic Important in Networking?

Ethernet is used to connect devices in a wired Local Area Network (LAN). Developed in the 1970s, Ethernet became the standard for wired networks due to its high speed and stability. The first standardized version was IEEE 802.3.

On the other hand, WLAN, based on the IEEE 802.11 standard, revolutionized connectivity by removing the dependence on wires in LANs around 1997. WLAN works via infrared or radio waves.

The combination of Ethernet and WLAN is crucial for integrating wired and wireless networks, enabling efficient and flexible management. Their combination offers several advantages:

- **Mobility:** Users can move freely without losing connection.
- **Scalability:** Adding new devices is easy without the need for extra cables.
- **Traffic Management:** Prioritizes network traffic to prevent congestion.
- **Enhanced Security:** New protocols like WPA3 improve network safety.

### Conclusion
Having a hybrid network that combines Ethernet and WLAN is essential for secure, fast, and efficient connectivity—especially in a world where remote work and online education are more common.

## Foundations and Working Principles

### Key Components

Before understanding how it works, it's essential to know the following components:

- **Access Points (APs):** Devices that act as intermediaries between the Ethernet network and wireless devices.
- **Routers and Switches:** Distribute the connection via Ethernet, linking APs and other devices.

### Network Structure

A combination of Ethernet and WLAN follows this structure:

1. Access points (APs) are connected via cable to the Ethernet network (router or switch).
2. Wireless devices (smartphones, laptops, etc.) connect to the access points via Wi-Fi.

### Standards

- **Ethernet (IEEE 802.3):** Defines data transmission over wired networks using copper or fiber optic cables.
- **WLAN (IEEE 802.11):** Establishes protocols for wireless communication.

### Implementation Modes

1. **Infrastructure Mode:** The standard setup where APs are connected to an Ethernet switch, allowing wireless devices to connect.
2. **Bridge Mode:** Two networks connect wirelessly via APs in bridge mode, eliminating the need for cables.
3. **Mesh Mode:** Multiple access points expand the Wi-Fi signal by acting as network nodes that relay data.
